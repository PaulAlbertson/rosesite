Text: Publicis Groupe&rsquo;s Rosetta today announced the launch of the first Commerce Center of Excellence in San Luis Obispo, CA, to serve as Rosetta&rsquo;s main hub for Commerce-related innovation, accelerate the agency&rsquo;s ability to deliver quality commerce solutions at scale on a global basis and allow the agency to demonstrate real and measurable value to clients and partners based on Rosetta&rsquo;s more than 10 years of Commerce experience.

Rosetta&rsquo;s Commerce Center of Excellence is the latest development in the expanded Smarter Commerce partnership Rosetta and Publicis announced with IBM last December and represents a significant investment by Publicis in Rosetta. In addition, it creates new opportunities for Publicis Groupe agencies to dock at Rosetta&rsquo;s San Luis Obispo campus and leverage the latest innovations in customer engagement and commerce-related technology solutions and services. 

The Center is designed to drive innovation in the integration of Commerce Plus offerings and branded experiences through superior customer insights, leading-edge technology and world class creative. It is staffed by a dedicated team of highly trained, multi-skilled specialists from Rosetta, who, in addition to consulting and mentoring Personalized Lifecycle Management and Commerce Plus clients agency-wide, will collaborate to develop and maintain training material, reference articles, templates, tools, procedures, methods and best practices.

In addition to showcasing Rosetta&rsquo;s industry-leading customer engagement and commerce solutions for current and prospective clients and Publicis agency partners, the Center will show Rosetta business partners – such as IBM, Adobe, Sitecore and Liferay – how their own offerings can be integrated into Rosetta&rsquo;s client assignments in order to drive additional innovation across the industry. The Center will display research initiatives, augmented reality, virtual shopping walls and screens, Personalized Lifecycle Management synergies, NFC and scanable interactions, personal catalogs, guided shopping experiences, digital wallets and much more.

Over the next two years, Rosetta also plans to hire a substantial number of new developers, engineers and visual and interface designers to build Commerce and content systems and create compelling user experiences.

Rosetta President Tom Adamski said, &ldquo;The Commerce Center of Excellence will drive continuous innovation in Commerce for Rosetta and our global partners and solidify our position as a world-class customer engagement agency. It creates new opportunities to help clients build and optimize Smarter Commerce-based marketing systems that drive customer engagement, strengthen brand relationships and optimize revenue. And it ensures that Rosetta&rsquo;s Commerce clients will gain access to the latest insights into consumer shopping behaviors and benefit from leading-edge technologies, devices and platforms that are rapidly redefining how consumers shop.&rdquo;

Rosetta General Manager, Global Commerce Lead, Gary Schoch, said, &ldquo;Clients today demand top line revenue growth in predictable timeframes and they want to see and interact with the latest innovations and solutions in Commerce. Thanks to advances in cloud computing and Rosetta&rsquo;s ability to deliver SaaS solutions, we are able to demonstrate real and measurable solutions to clients – including omni-channel consumer experiences delivered by highly personalized, targeted and relevant messaging across mobile, social, kiosk, call center and web. The Center of Excellence is truly an innovation factory that brings ideas to life and ensures that Rosetta will remain ahead of the innovation curve.  In conjunction with our joint partnership with IBM, we are able to work together to bring these solutions to market for clients around the world.&rdquo;

Rosetta&rsquo;s Commerce-related revenues are expected to surpass $100 million this year, fueled in part by a global expansion of the agency&rsquo;s 10+ year partnership with IBM. Rosetta is among the top sellers of IBM Smarter Commerce software and has completed more than 150 commerce implementations. The agency expects Commerce-related revenues to approach more than $300 million by 2015 and plans to launch dedicated Commerce hubs in Western Europe, China and Latin America in the next three years.

Rosetta&rsquo;s experienced team of Commerce specialists serves a rapidly expanding and diverse global client list that includes Dorel (Consumer Products/US), Genco (Distribution/US), hhgregg (Electronics Retail/US), Holt-Renfrew (Luxury Retail/Canada), Luxottica (Eyewear Retail/Italy), Newell-Rubbermaid (Consumer Products/US) and Sigma Pharma (Manufacturer of Over-The-Counter and Prescription Drugs/Australia).

The Commerce Center of Excellence is located in Rosetta&rsquo;s new 47,000 sq. ft. West Coast headquarters, which opened in mid-April. In addition to the Commerce Center, the new space features a state-of-the-art 3,500 sq. ft. Video and Motion Graphics (VMG) production studio that will be used to create premium audio and video content for web, mobile, social and TV experiences. The studio includes broadcast-ready capabilities, with a video and audio control room and live/post production; color and edit bay, as well as color correction; world-class acoustics; and 3D and motion capture capabilities.
