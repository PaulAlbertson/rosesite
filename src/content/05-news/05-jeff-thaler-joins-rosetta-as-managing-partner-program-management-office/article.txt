In this new executive-level position, Thaler will lead a team of more than 100 program and project management professionals operating at the intersection of Rosetta&rsquo;s five industry Verticals (Consumer Packaging &amp; Retail, Distribution Manufacturing &amp; Utilities, Financial Services, Healthcare and Technology &amp; Telecommunications) and six Practice Areas (Marketing Strategy &amp; Insights, Brand Interaction &amp; Planning, Creative &amp; Customer Experience, Technology, Paid/Owned &amp; Earned Media and Data Analysis &amp; Optimization) for its roster of global clients.

The hiring also strengthens Rosetta&rsquo;s ability to deliver quality commerce solutions at scale on a global basis as part of the expanded Smarter Commerce partnership Rosetta and Publicis announced with IBM last December. Rosetta is among the top sellers of IBM Smarter Commerce software and has completed more than 150 commerce implementations. The agency recently launched the first Commerce Center of Excellence to leverage Rosetta services and solutions and IBM Smarter Commerce technologies to drive innovation in customer engagement and commerce.

&ldquo;Jeff&rsquo;s skillset as a Program Management leader and broad experience across numerous industries and geographies comes to Rosetta at the perfect time,&rdquo; said Taylor. &ldquo;His ability to activate multi-disciplinary teams comprised of agency, vendor and client stakeholders matches our trajectory of delivering solutions of increased sophistication and business impact for our clients.&rdquo;

Thaler is a pioneer in the digital marketing arena. He was a founder and principal at the fashion industry boutique agency Hurricane Interactive Technology Solutions (HITS), which opened its doors in 1995. A veteran program management and operations expert, he possesses broad and deep knowledge of the development, assessment and optimization of marketing and technology service delivery processes. Thaler has a successful track record of building and working with Program Management teams for some of the largest agency networks and client-side organizations in the world.

Most recently, Thaler led the Digital Marketing and CRM Delivery Management function within the Fortune 500 global marketing giant Kimberly-Clark on behalf of WPP&rsquo;s Mindshare. Prior to that, he led the Program Management practice and served on the senior leadership team for Aegis&rsquo; integrated marketing agency Carat.  Thaler has also held similar positions leading local, regional and global teams at Omnicom&rsquo;s Tribal DDB and IPG&rsquo;s McCann Worldgroup. His background includes experience in television production, creative &amp; technical development, CRM, online publishing and education, including teaching elementary school, as well as Media and Production courses at Rutgers University. Thaler holds a masters degree in Curriculum &amp; Teaching from Columbia University.

Thaler will be based in Rosetta&rsquo;s New York office and will operate across Rosetta&rsquo;s North American and growing international locations.
