Text: Rosetta, the Publicis Groupe customer engagement agency, announced today that it has hired industry veterans Nikki Muntz and Eileen O&rsquo;Brien to support growth and business development in the Healthcare Vertical.  Both will be part of the Healthcare Vertical Leadership Team, under the direction of Vertical Leader, Shannon Hartley. 

&quot;Our strong growth in the vertical is being fueled by client demand for personalized marketing.  Creating true personalized programs demands deep customer insights, multi-channel marketing experiences and robust analytics to optimize client ROI,&quot; said Hartley. &quot;Nikki and Eileen bring together the right mix of capabilities we need to continue to lead the industry and redefine the way healthcare and pharma brands engage customers across marketing and product experiences. I am excited about the value they'll bring to our clients and agency, and I&rsquo;m proud of the leadership team we have assembled that is driving our strong growth.  We have an outstanding mix of talent across customer insights, strategy, creative, technology, media and analytics to bring personalized marketing to life for our clients across the full spectrum of the adoption lifecycle.&quot;

Prior to her work at Shaw Science, Muntz spent almost nine years at Cell Division, which was acquired by&nbsp;Euro RSCG Life LM&amp;P, as the VP of Business Development, focusing on growing the digital and medical education business for the agency in the healthcare space. &nbsp;Before that, she spent several years at Merck as a sales representative, trainer and marketer. &nbsp;She will be based in Rosetta&rsquo;s Princeton office.
