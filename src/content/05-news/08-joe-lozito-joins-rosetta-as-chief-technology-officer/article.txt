Text: Rosetta, the Publicis Groupe customer engagement agency and IBM Smarter Commerce Partner, announced today that Joe Lozito has joined the agency as Chief Technology Officer and a member of its Operating Committee. He will be based in Rosetta&rsquo;s New York and Hamilton, NJ offices and report to Rosetta&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer Mark Taylor.

In this role, Lozito will oversee Rosetta&rsquo;s Technology Practice, which includes over 400 architects, engineers and developers, along with a strong group of quality assurance professionals and business analysts. The Technology Practice serves as the foundation for Rosetta&rsquo;s integrated content, commerce, personalization and innovative connected device solutions. 

&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s depth of experience and proven track record of technology innovation make him an ideal addition to our leadership team,&rdquo; Taylor said. &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome a professional of Joe&rsquo;s caliber to Rosetta&rsquo;s talented team, continuing our focus on industry leading solutions that drive material and measurable business impact for our clients.&rdquo;

With more than 15 years of technology leadership experience, Lozito has overseen the development of extensive software implementations for clients such as Kraft, Whirlpool, Sprint, Delta and Panasonic.  He joins Rosetta from Digitas, where he served as Senior Vice President, Technology, North America and led a team of technical architects, designers and developers that was responsible for the execution of the brand experience across technologies and devices.  He also started Digitas Labs and launched physical Innovation Rooms in the New York and Boston offices to demonstrate the evolving technology landscape through emerging user experiences.  Prior to Digitas, Lozito held senior technology positions at R/GA, J Walter Thompson and Information Builders. Lozito also has published widely on commerce, delivery, quality assurance and leadership of onshore and offshore teams.

The hiring strengthens Rosetta&rsquo;s ability to deliver quality commerce solutions at scale on a global basis as part of the expanded Smarter Commerce partnership Rosetta and Publicis announced with IBM last December. Rosetta is among the top sellers of IBM Smarter Commerce software and has completed more than 150 commerce implementations. The agency <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130617-907070.html" target="_blank">recently launched</a> the first Commerce Center of Excellence to leverage Rosetta services and solutions and IBM Smarter Commerce technologies to drive innovation in customer engagement and commerce. 

Lozito will also play a major role in the development of Rosetta&rsquo;s Innovation Labs in Cleveland and Princeton that will showcase and drive innovation in customer engagement and commerce. 

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly excited to join an agency I consider to be the best kept secret in the industry,&rdquo; said Lozito. &ldquo;Rosetta exists at a critical juncture in the today&rsquo;s marketplace, bringing together best-of-breed expertise in commerce, personalized lifecycle management and innovation. I can&rsquo;t think of a brand that wouldn&rsquo;t benefit from that know-how. Rosetta&rsquo;s world-class technology chops play a major role in activating the insights, data and experiences across the consumer journey over time.&rdquo;
