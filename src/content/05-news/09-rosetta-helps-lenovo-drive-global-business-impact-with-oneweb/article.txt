Text: Publicis Groupe <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a> Rosetta was tapped by Lenovo (HKSE: 992) (ADR: LNVGY) to develop OneWeb, a recently launched commerce and interactive brand experience that is flexible and responsive to changing consumer needs. Lenovo recently began rolling out its new sites globally, adjusting each one for local languages, cultures and consumer needs. The U.S. site can be found at <a href="http://www.lenovo.com" target="_blank">www.lenovo.com</a>.

Rosetta helped Lenovo redesign the site to deliver streamlined navigation across its vast selection of product offerings, while catering to the needs of the early-adaptor &ldquo;Millennials&rdquo; target market.

&ldquo;With a more engaging and responsive site, we expect the new brand experience to deliver substantially higher order values,&rdquo; said Rick Medeiros, Lenovo&rsquo;s executive director of global usability and user experience. &ldquo;Rosetta has been instrumental in helping us drive material business impact by translating deep consumer insights into personally relevant brand experiences.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Lenovo&rsquo;s OneWeb is significant because it is based on data-driven insights,&rdquo; said Eli Grant, Associate Partner at Rosetta. &ldquo;We worked together with Lenovo to create measurable business impact by employing unique insights that create deeper levels of customer engagement. That&rsquo;s the secret to any successful commerce experience.&rdquo;

In the development of the site, Rosetta <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2013/06/03/how-lenovo-knows-its-new-site-design-will-boost-sales" target="_blank">tested it</a> by sending five percent of Lenovo&rsquo;s total U.S. site visitors during one month to the new website and compared their behaviors with the same size sample of visitors to the previous site. As a result, shoppers on the new site had an average double-digit increase in revenue per visit as well as a similarly higher conversion rate. Additionally, the new site led more visitors to product pages and to the shopping cart.
