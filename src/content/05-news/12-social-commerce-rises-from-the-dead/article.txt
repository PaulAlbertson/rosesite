Two years ago, selling products directly on social platforms seemed to be the wave of the future.  Brands like 1-800-Flowers and Levi's were lavished with positive press  for their social commerce launches. The overall results were  disappointing, however, and panned by the industry as inefficient.  Social commerce, many felt, was dead on arrival.

Now, though, a new wave of brands is proving that with an innovative  perspective, success is possible in this space. Instead of just buying a  new purse, for example, users of <a href="http://littleblackbag.com">littleblackbag.com</a> swap their new purses within a community. <a href="http://adage.com/directory/american-express-co/202" title="See recent content about American Express">American Express</a> cardholders can make purchases by adding a <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-12/business/37049947_1_twitter-accounts-hashtag-active-users">hashtag</a> to their Twitter posts.

Successful brands have learned that simply adapting the .com  experience for social channels is a path to failure. Brands need to view  social channels as what they are and reward their communities' loyalty  with exclusive products, one-of-a-kind deals and experiences that  ultimately lead to increased passion from their followers. Without this,  a brand's energies will be better focused on other marketing  initiatives.

Social is playing a critical role in how we think about selling,  profit and generating revenue. Notions of what we decide to share about  ourselves and how we interact within the global community have shifted  along with the growth of social platforms.

Users have become more comfortable releasing their data to brands in exchange for value. A <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/11/20/online-shopping-privacy-study/">2012 study</a> by Accenture found that 61% of online shoppers would be willing to give  up data for personally relevant offers; 75% of online shoppers  preferred retailers that use personal information to improve the  shopping experience.

As customers' attitudes have evolved, social data have become  integrated more fully into search engines to produce personalized search  results. Social platforms are also willing to part with data. With the  recent launch of <a href="http://www.facebook-studio.com/news/item/partner-categories-a-new-self-serve-targeting-feature">Partner Categories</a>,  Facebook is combing data from third-market sources, along with its own  data, to leverage in robust ad targeting and re-targeting. Assuming that  the user gives permission, Facebook is also willing to give brands  access to a user's newsfeed, photos, like data, friend data, etc.,  allowing brands to not only create customized experiences on their  platform, but totally immersed, customizable experiences on a native  website (see Intel's <a href="http://www.intel.com/museumofme/en_US/r/index.htm">Museum of Me</a> or Grey Poupon's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greypoupon">Society of Great Taste</a>).

It isn't simply just using social data, but combining that data with  other sources that can really lead a brand into providing a great  commerce experience.

If a large Internet retailer could take the data it has about your  shopping habits (what you've purchased, what items you've done research  on) and combine that with data points obtained through your social  activity (what brands you like, what your friends like, where you check  in), they could produce such a relevant site experience. Instead of  showcasing everything in the store, they would be able to narrow down  the selection to only things that you would be interested in – what we  call the &quot;segment of one.&quot;

We have to include the social web in our commerce experiences, use  social data to personalize these experiences and ensure that we are  complementing our other activities to create winning experiences that  meet our customers' needs -- and drive more revenue.
