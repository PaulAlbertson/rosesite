Text: Publicis Groupe <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a> Rosetta was highlighted for its "full breadth of customer experience management (CEM) services via extensive technical knowledge, proven creative excellence, and established methodologies" in a report released today by Digital Clarity Group on Service Providers for Web Content and Customer Experience Management.

"Customer experience management is hard, complicated, and new," said Dr. Tim Walters, Partner and Principal Analyst, DCG. "Very few organizations have all of the in-house resources necessary to deploy the technologies, formulate the strategies, and optimize the outcomes. Most companies should – and will – turn to external service providers for assistance."

"As brands fight to gain a competitive advantage via a more engaging customer experience, we are seeing greater emphasis on picking technology solutions that can enhance the entire ecosystem of interactions," said Joe Lozito, Chief Technology Officer at Rosetta. "It's less about traditional web content management than about a platform for experience management."

Rosetta was noted for its vendor-agnostic consulting services for Web Content Management projects and its active partnerships with IBM, Adobe, Sitecore, Microsoft SharePoint and Liferay. The report states, "Rosetta combines technology skills with its agency services, such as marketing strategy, brand planning, and social and analytics, making the company a potential fit for large technology projects that are integrated with broader commerce, personalized marketing, and loyalty campaigns."

"Success requires a combination of in-depth knowledge of the client's business and customers, plus the ability to integrate technology, creative and marketing to deploy a truly engaging experience," said Rosetta Director Kavita Basdeo. "Rosetta was engineered to achieve these things and we are excited to be recognized by Digital Clarity Group."

According to the report, "The forces of digital disruption have empowered consumers and created a growing demand for rich, engaging, and consistent experiences across multiple channels and touchpoints. Customer experience management (CEM) designates an evolving set of practices, technologies, partnerships, and business values that, taken together, enable organizations to orchestrate, offer, and optimize consistently superior customer experiences. <em>Mastering CEM is an imperative</em> because the quality of the experiences you offer and support will increasingly determine the fate of your company."
