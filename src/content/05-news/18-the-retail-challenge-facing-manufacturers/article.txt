Omni-channel, the latest retailing model, represents a  seismic shift for manufacturers. This form of retailing lets consumers  move seamlessly among real and virtual retail environments, as if they  were one. If you&rsquo;ve shopped at Home Depot (<a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=HD" target="_blank">HD</a>), you&rsquo;ve been able to check inventory by store, buy online, and pick up the product at the location of your choice.

This  holistic approach is quickly becoming the norm. To support the shift,  manufacturers need to rethink the consumer experience, unify the supply  chain, and get internal departments to collaborate. In particular, they  need to take four steps:

<strong>Hear the &ldquo;why&rdquo; firsthand</strong>.   Omni-channel rewards manufacturers for connecting with consumers  early—often before the initial purchase—and maintaining those  connections. To hear &ldquo;why I&rsquo;ll buy&rdquo; firsthand, manufacturers need to  establish direct, personal relationships with consumers. They can engage  consumers through contests, invitations to product testing panels,  sponsorship of events, and social media participation.

<strong>Value the interaction, not just the transaction</strong>.  Because loyalty efforts have been focused on post-transaction  activities, like warranty registrations, manufacturers typically learn  little about buyers and nothing about non-buyers. They need to start  earlier in the sales process, making it worthwhile for consumers to  share information and engage with their brands through social media.  That means access to unique features, content, or events. The more value  exchanged before consumers reach retail, the more insulated a brand is  from in-store switching to competitive products.

<strong>Unify fulfillment</strong>.  Omni-channel dictates that retailers consolidate inventories, so  consumers and salespeople alike can see and order from all that is  available throughout the retail ecosystem, whether via a distribution  center or store shelf. To speed fulfillment, manufacturers need to  become more agile in replenishing retail distribution points. They need  systems integration and enhanced communication to keep abreast of rapid  changes in product demand.

<strong>Embrace showrooming</strong>. <a href="http://retailingtoday.com/article/study-showrooming-lesser-threat-once-thought" target="_blank">Research shows</a> that consumers use smartphones in-store principally to confirm a choice  or narrow down multiple options, not to make a purchase from an  alternative retailer such as Amazon (<a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=AMZN" target="_blank">AMZN</a>).  As more chains make free Wi-Fi available to shoppers, manufacturers  need to provide digital content that supports in-store decision-making.  For example, John Deere (<a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=DE" target="_blank">DE</a>)  could provide Home Depot with video content that helps shoppers compare  various models or understand the setup, maintenance, and accessories  that each lawn tractor requires.

Winning in omni-channel calls for new levels of transparency and  communication. Manufacturers must get in lockstep with retail partners  when it comes to merchandise planning and promotion. While that may  sound scary at first, future category leaders will be much more open  about their plans. The partners and customer advocates they gain will be  more than worth the growing pains.
