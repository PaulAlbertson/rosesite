Social media and digital engagement are inherently tricky for the  pharmaceutical industry, which lacks specific guidelines for social  media—especially regarding how drugs should be marketed in the social  space. The beauty of adopting a content-focused plan is that it allows  Pharma to concentrate their messages on providing value and  disseminating information to a highly defined target without getting  hung up in engagement and communications loopholes.

<strong>How does Pharma engage without engaging?</strong>

By telling a story and providing resources you can become a valuable  and welcome addition to your end users&rsquo; social media mix without the  risk of engaging in touchy conversations. As a content creator, you  start the conversation, and you own the message and the moderation. For  many healthcare brands, the need to disable comments on social channels  or steer clear of two-way conversations in open channels provides a  challenge in engaging the right audience. Such brands often resort to  proprietary communities or limit their social engagement to blogging.

If you create vibrant content and strategize the right distribution  points, you can broaden your digital presence and achieve social scale  without navigating the two-way conversation rapids. By thinking about  the end user, the stories and resources that the user wants and needs,  the brand can become a valuable asset no matter what entry point they  take.

<strong>You&rsquo;ve got the science, now get the sexy!</strong>

The good news is, you likely already have a ton of content: studies,  research, data, insights and testimonials. The challenge is how do you  package it so it catches your target audience&rsquo;s attention? Once you&rsquo;ve  got your sexy on, where do you strut your stuff?

Great listening audits synched with your end user information as well  as key terms associated with your drug category will not only tell you  where the folks are, but what kind of content they are already  consuming. With this knowledge comes power – the power to craft your  content into stories, graphics and videos that will truly break through  and drive engagement from the right people, in the right manner.

Consider working with digital creatives to leverage these insights to  develop unique and sharable pieces of content (e.g., infographics,  motion graphics, and patient stories in animations or interviews). You  can then distribute this engaging content via Facebook and Twitter, as  well as digital ad units, email, and blogs that will have legs beyond  your own channels and will be shared with your users&rsquo; networks. Of  course you&rsquo;ll need to follow all necessary disclaimers within this  content.

Going back to your listening audit you should have a good idea of  where your target user is engaging. Whether you have a presence in that  channel or not, you can still reach them and get the clicks you deserve.  There are a few ways to do this. For Facebook, highly targeted paid ad  units are an effective approach as is general sharing of the content  from your blog and website. For Twitter, getting partner influencers or  medical journals to distribute your content will reach your audience  (always noting any relevant disclaimers). Leveraging paid media units  like Google CPC and other iAd units that follow your targeting will give  you additional scale. Remember to ensure the content is sharable to  increase the potential for organic virality once you&rsquo;ve captured users&rsquo;  attention.

Now that you&rsquo;ve figured out how to convert that mass of information  you have into viable, attractive content AND you&rsquo;ve distributed it in a  strategic way, it&rsquo;s time to regulate and perfect. What is so amazing  about social and digital is that, rather than performing a zillion  trials to get the product right, you can immediately change the formula.  With real-time insights you can immediately see how your campaign is  doing, meaning you can optimize by quickly adjusting your strategy. If  your infographic is doing really well on Tumblr but not on Pinterest,  you can stop investing as much time in Pinterest and increase production  for Tumblr.

The options for the right formula are endless, the prescription for  the best results will change month over month, but the baseline  diagnoses is that content is king, even for Pharma companies, no matter  what your social footprint is. And with that I&rsquo;ll spare you any more  medical analogies and let you start combing your library for content  thought starters!
