To truly innovate in today's world of emerging technology, responsive  Web design, and connected devices requires a fluid and fit agency  model. It's agile (lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo;), risky, and absolutely necessary to  anticipate the industry's constantly evolving course.

The worst thing to happen to innovation is that it became a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;—a  buzzword. As with most vaguely &ldquo;technical&rdquo; terms, as soon as innovation  became hot, heads turned to the technology departments. Suddenly, the  onus was on tech to bring &ldquo;shiny objects&rdquo; to the table regardless of  relevance. But that's not innovation, that's &ldquo;tech for tech's sake.&rdquo;  True innovation doesn't come from any one department; it can come from  anywhere. It comes from the <a href="http://www.dmnews.com/3-ways-marketing-and-it-mesh/article/299792/" target="_blank">early collaboration</a> of open thinkers focused on a client need. But that kind of close,  cross-disciplinary working relationship is hard to come by in the  traditional agency model.

The change must start at the intersection of the creative and  technology teams. They are seasoned veterans to the ebb and flow of  client wins and losses. But in the current agency wheelhouse, these  teams are typically at end of the cycle. While marketing, account  planning, and strategy are all assigned early in a client engagement,  the creative and tech teams are typically benched until they get the  flight plans. It's an approach that not only stunts some of the most  talented minds in the agency, but it puts those same people in jeopardy  of being underutilized, uninspired and, possibly, cut from the team.  It's bad for culture and stifles innovation.

Remember, if someone has chosen to work at an agency, regardless of  the role, that person typically has a creative bent. Regardless of their  &ldquo;department&rdquo;—technology, marketing, finance, ops—these people are  probably also in a band, they might published authors, they might e  bloggers, or even training for their next marathon. The key is to  harness those creative energies toward innovation on behalf of clients,  especially at times when workflow is at a slow point. Breaking this  cycle, however, requires a completely different game plan and leaders  within the organization who are willing to invest in the new approach.

I know, I know. The word &ldquo;invest&rdquo; has no doubt sent shivers down your  spine. But don't close your browser yet. I'm not saying an agency needs  to set aside bags of money for innovation; that's just not realistic in  this day and age. I'm saying that our business has natural ebbs and  flows, pockets of free time in which our creative resources are free to  play with evolving and emerging technologies. They're doing it in their  spare time anyway, so why not harness that?

Of course, the trick is knowing when that spare time is coming.  Forecasting will always be an issue for agencies. Our work is just  volatile by nature. Account teams don't want to over-forecast, which  means development teams are constantly understaffed. It's important to  have great, plugged-in resource managers who can help juggle  ever-changing schedules. And, of course, having all  capabilities—creative, tech, etc.—embedded from the start helps with  this issue as well, since both sides have a vested interest in making it  successful.

To paraphrase <em>The Incredibles</em>: Once everyone's innovative, no  one is. Innovation isn't a thing; it's a way of thinking. And it doesn't  come from one person or one team; it comes from collaboration. If we're  being honest with ourselves, we need to change the agency culture so  that innovative thinking permeates all the work we do. But in this case,  to be more fluid in our process, we must create a tighter structure  that allows the ideas to flow. The true innovation comes when you're not  looking for it.
