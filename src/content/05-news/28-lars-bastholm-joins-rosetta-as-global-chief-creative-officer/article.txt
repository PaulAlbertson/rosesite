Text: Rosetta announced today that Lars Bastholm has joined as Global Chief Creative Officer, the first for Publicis Groupe&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a>. In this new role, Bastholm will oversee the work of creative staffers and help lead Rosetta&rsquo;s global expansion. 

Throughout Bastholm&rsquo;s 18-year career, he has held the global Chief Creative Officer role at agencies such as Cheil USA, Ogilvy &amp; Mather and AKQA, and he has led client engagements for brands such as IKEA, Nike, Motorola, LEGO and Coca-Cola. 

&ldquo;Lars is one of the most recognized and internationally renowned creative leaders in the industry,&rdquo; said Rosetta Chief Executive Officer Tom Adamski. &ldquo;He clearly understands creative&rsquo;s role in driving customer engagement and has an admirable track record in building world-class creative organizations.&rdquo;

Bastholm&rsquo;s last position was as Chief Creative Officer of Cheil USA, where he helped establish Cheil USA as a center of creative excellence for the network and elevated the creative integration across the Americas network, including Mexico, Brazil, Canada and Central America. 

Previously, he helped fuel Ogilvy North America&rsquo;s digital transformation as Chief Digital Creative Officer and led Ogilvy New York&rsquo;s creative group as Chief Creative Officer. 

In 2004, Bastholm opened up AKQA&rsquo;s first New York office, ultimately becoming Co-Chief Creative Officer for North America before leaving in 2009.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to joining a group of hungry and passionate colleagues at this very exciting time of growth and expansion for Rosetta,&rdquo; Bastholm said. &ldquo;Rosetta has been flying somewhat under the radar in the agency community, but its growing global client roster and outstanding work ensures that it won&rsquo;t be for long.&rdquo;

Bastholm has served on IAB&rsquo;s Agency Advisory Board, and he is a member of The International Academy of Digital Arts &amp; Sciences. He has a Master of Arts in American Studies &amp; Film from Syddansk Universitet in Denmark.
