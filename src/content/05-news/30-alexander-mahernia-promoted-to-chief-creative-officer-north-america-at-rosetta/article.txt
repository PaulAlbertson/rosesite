Text: Publicis Groupe <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a> Rosetta announced today that Alexander Mahernia has been promoted to Chief Creative Officer, North America. He will report to Global Chief Creative Officer Lars Bastholm, who <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lars-bastholm-joins-rosetta-as-global-chief-creative-officer-231144651.html" target="_blank">recently joined the agency</a>, and help lead insights-driven creative execution across Rosetta&rsquo;s diverse client roster. Mahernia will also sit on Rosetta&rsquo;s Operating Committee. 

&ldquo;Alex has done an exceptional job leading the creative team and helping to define the creative vision of the Rosetta brand over the last seven months in his role as interim Chief Creative Officer,&rdquo; said Rosetta&rsquo;s Global Chief Creative Officer Lars Bastholm. &ldquo;His skills as an innovator and leader are a tremendous asset to our team, and I value his partnership. Together we will elevate the role of creative across our growing global client roster and play a large part in driving Rosetta&rsquo;s global growth and expansion.&rdquo; 

Mahernia served as Chief Creative Officer and Co-Founder of LEVEL Studios, the integrated marketing and product development agency that Rosetta acquired in 2010. After the acquisition, he became Managing Partner, Executive Creative Director and played an integral role in driving coast-to-coast operational growth, nurturing a culture of innovation and fostering management transparency across Rosetta. 

The promotion of Mahernia represents the latest in a number of significant talent moves made by Rosetta Chief Executive Officer Tom Adamski since taking over in April 2013. In the last six months, the agency has hired Global Chief Creative Officer Lars Bastholm; Chief Strategy Officer Scott Sorokin; Chief Technology Officer Joe Lozito; Managing Partner, Program Management Office Jeff Thaler; and Partner, Head of Marketing Gary Schechner.

Mahernia began his career at WebThink International, where he was Co-Founder and Creative Director. He was the Creative Director at WebAssociates from 1999 until 2008, working across consumer electronics, gaming, entertainment and software/application design. He received the &ldquo;40 Under 40&rdquo; Award from <em>DM News</em> in 2012.
