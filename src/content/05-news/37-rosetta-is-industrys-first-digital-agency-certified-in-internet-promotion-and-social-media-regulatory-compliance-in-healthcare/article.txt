Text: Publicis Groupe <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a> Rosetta is the first digital agency to achieve full certification in Internet Promotion and Social Media regulatory compliance from the Center for Communication Compliance (CCC), the world's only all-in-one source for training, testing, and consulting in healthcare regulatory compliance and risk communication. The achievement certifies that Rosetta team members possess comprehensive knowledge of regulatory compliance in the healthcare industry, including the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM381352.pdf" target="_blank">draft guidance</a> on interactive promotional media issued by the FDA last month.

Shannon Hartley, Managing Partner, Rosetta Healthcare Industry Group Leader, said, &quot;Meeting the evolving digital expectations of today's healthcare practitioners and patients requires regulatory compliance savvy. We're proud to establish a leadership position in the industry through an agency-wide commitment to digital marketing excellence, as we require everyone working on healthcare client business to certify that they understand all current regulations and requirements. By filtering our strategic and tactical recommendations through a regulatory compliance lens, our programs become more actionable and efficient. Everyone wins: our clients receive optimal counsel, and we increase our partnership value.&quot;

Rosetta team members were asked to pass a 56-question certification test with questions covering sponsored and unsponsored promotion, disease state and product specific promotion, adverse event reporting, chat rooms, patient testimonials, <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/services/">search engine optimization</a>, and responses to unsolicited questions about off-label information.  The coursework also examined how to apply current guidelines, rules and policies to the development and execution of social media promotional materials, formats, and programs, including SEO and SEM considerations.

&quot;Rosetta is a model for compliance excellence and risk mitigation,&quot; said Ilyssa Levins, CCC president. &quot;It's a reasonable expectation that marketing teams and their promotional agencies come to the table with a thorough knowledge of regulatory compliance basics. Being on the same knowledge baseline is particularly important when teams collaborate in the digital realm because regulatory/legal risks and digital platforms are constantly evolving. Team members who haven't mastered the basics become impediments to efficient and successful collaboration as new terrain is explored.&quot;

Levins added:  &quot;Rosetta chose to be proactive to help their clients reduce risk, increase efficiencies and save time and money.&quot;

The Center for Communication Compliance (<a href="http://www.communicationcompliance.com" target="_blank">www.communicationcompliance.com</a>) is the world's only all-in-one source for training, testing, and consulting in healthcare regulatory compliance and risk communication.

CCC has a portfolio of proprietary strategies and tools to help companies sustain a competitive advantage in a compliant culture where government restrictions are tighter than ever before. Its web-based products are validated by an advisory board of former FDA officials and regulatory lawyers. CCC's off-the-shelf and customized products include Train+Test Systems, regulatory compliance screeners and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure whether compliance programs are effectively managing risk and supporting development of promotional materials with high impact.
