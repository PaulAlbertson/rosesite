Text: Rosetta has hired former SapientNitro Vice President, Business Lead Eric Healy as Managing Partner of its Consumer Products &amp; Retail Industry Group. Healy will report directly to Chief Executive Officer Tom Adamski and lead a talent-rich team that has earned industry recognition for its ability to deliver omni-channel strategy and experience-driven <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/solutions/commerce.html">commerce solutions</a> on behalf of a rapidly growing roster of global clients.

At SapientNitro, Healy led a wide range of multi-channel marketing, commerce and technology engagements on behalf of Fortune 500 clients from the agency&rsquo;s Boston office.  While there, he expanded SapientNitro&rsquo;s core offerings, successfully grew its creative team from 14 to nearly 200 professionals, and directly contributed to the quadrupling of Boston office revenues in less than a four-year time period.

&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been extraordinarily fortunate to add some industry heavyweights to our leadership team throughout the last year, and Eric is a true superstar, with a glowing record of business development, growth and expansion during the last 16 years,&rdquo; said Adamski. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the right leader at the right time to strengthen and solidify our reputation across the rapidly changing consumer products and retail industry.&rdquo;

Healy said, &ldquo;Rosetta clearly stands out against its digitally led competitors through its remarkable ability to marry human behavior with business impact. They have not only developed, but earned, trusted advisor status with their clients by transforming, optimizing and redefining their businesses through applied intelligence, the extraordinary understanding of what motivates consumers throughout their journeys, and the ability to both design and deliver technologies to deliver successful, compelling and engaging experiences. The opportunity to build upon Rosetta&rsquo;s current success in the Consumer Products &amp; Retail space was irresistible, and I look forward to partnering with a broader set of Rosetta teams to not only deliver groundbreaking work, but also help lead the industry in how companies and brands create truly meaningful connections with their customers.&rdquo;

Prior to joining SapientNitro, Healy served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Development &amp; Network Director for advertising and media giant Aegis, plc, where he was responsible for the solicitation, negotiation and oversight of strategic partnership and investment activity for Aegis Media North America and digital marketing services arm, Isobar. In his role, Healy supported North American group presidents with their related growth strategies, while also overseeing post-acquisition assimilation and integration efforts. Healy also served in critical business development and relationship management functions and provided cross unit integration across 48 agencies, 108 offices and 38 countries.

Healy&rsquo;s career in marketing spans both traditional and interactive agencies. He was Senior Vice President, Director of Interactive at IPG-owned Mullen. Reporting to Mullen&rsquo;s CEO, Healy developed the agency&rsquo;s digital offering into a multi-million practice area. At Arnold Worldwide, Healy oversaw the agency&rsquo;s Interactive practice before being asked to lead all strategy, integrated marketing and creative development for the EFFIE award-winning Vonage account. Earlier, at Digitas, Healy ran the agency&rsquo;s Retail practice and spearheaded a wide of array of digital marketing initiatives for its Boston-based clients.

Healy&rsquo;s earlier career involved client side roles as Director of eCommerce and Global Direct Marketing at Reebok International Limited and as founding Director of Interactive for Reebok subsidiary The Rockport Company.

Healy holds dual Master of Science degrees in Management and Marketing from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He is a member of many leading marketing organizations including the American Marketing Association, the Massachusetts Innovation &amp; Technology Exchange, and until recently, served on the Board of Ad Club Boston.
