Text: Paul Elliott, Managing Partner at Publicis Groupe&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">Rosetta</a>, headlines today&rsquo;s Adobe Summit Retail Industry Super Session with a presentation titled &ldquo;The Future of Retail: Insights from Retail Innovators&rdquo; that will be presented in partnership with Michael Klein, Director, Industry Strategy and Marketing at Adobe and Ryan Bonifacino, Vice President, Digital Strategy at Alex and Ani, LLC. The presentation takes place today from 9:30-10:30 a.m. MDT in front of the general audience in Ballroom AC.

In the presentation, Elliott will highlight omni-channel mandatories for retailers and illustrate the role of technology in moving consumers from experiences to brand engagement. Elliott was recently featured in <a href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/rush-beacon-tech-a-plan/292099/" target="_blank">Ad Age</a> with an opinion piece about the need for retail marketers to know their customers on a deeper level before rushing for beacon-tech gold.

&ldquo;We must start to better understand the needs and wants of today&rsquo;s consumers, who are empowered by their own use of technology and informed by their social connections,&rdquo; said Elliott. &ldquo;They are longing for unique and highly personalized experiences that demonstrate an understanding of who they are and a valuing of their business and loyalty. Yet all too often, retailers continue to fail to deliver on those expectations because of organizational siloes, lack of visibility to the customer across channels, and the belief that we need to &lsquo;comp&rsquo; or repeat everything we did last year.&rdquo;

In partnership with Adobe, Rosetta <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rosetta-drives-commerce-innovation-by-connecting-ibm-websphere-commerce-to-adobe-experience-manager-ecommerce-integration-framework-225806931.html" target="_blank">recently launched</a> a customizable and scalable proprietary extension of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) that connects with IBM WebSphere Commerce, giving marketing and IT departments greater ability to manage and optimize the commerce and content ecosystem, from brand engagement to immersive shopping experiences to checkout.
