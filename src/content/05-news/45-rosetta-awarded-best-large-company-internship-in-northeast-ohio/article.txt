Text: Rosetta, a <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a> within the Publicis Groupe network, today announced the Northeast Ohio Council on Higher Education (NOCHE) has named the agency's college internship program the Best Large Company Internship in Northeast Ohio. Sponsored by NOCHE and CBC Magazine, the <a href="https://www.noche.org/expys" target="_blank">Expy's Best Internship Awards</a> ceremony took place in Independence, Ohio on March 27, 2014. Additional awards were given in the categories of Best Intern, Best Mentor, Best College Advisor, Best New Internship, Coolest Internship and Best Small Company Internship.

During Rosetta's college internship program, students focused on client engagement, training, performance management, cultural engagement and volunteer efforts. A total of 77 interns from 29 universities completed Rosetta's internship program company wide in 2013, with nearly half of the interns who completed the program offered additional opportunities with the agency in 2014.

Mary Dieglio, a member of Miami University's 2014 graduating class, completed the Analytics &amp; Optimization internship in 2013 and will be joining Rosetta's San Francisco-based team after graduation. On her experiences with the agency Dieglio said, &quot;Having had three internships during the course of my college career, I can say that this one was definitely the most formative. I learned how to build and maintain good working relationships, both with the client and my teammates. My team gave me a lot of responsibility, which both built my confidence and pushed me to always perform above and beyond.&quot;

Weekly professional development trainings are provided to help students develop valuable skills that create a foundation for successful careers. Members of the agency's Executive Committee, including CEO Tom Adamski, participated in the professional development program. Sessions included video editing training, performance review and career management.

&quot;We're always focused on creating challenges for our students that they do not have the opportunity to see in the classroom,&quot; said Halley Marsh, Rosetta's College Recruiting Manager. &quot;Our interns encounter real client requests that our agency handles on a daily basis, as well as the added difficulty of working with fellow interns located in three different time-zones and among all nine of our agency locations. This is as real-world as it gets and gives them a preview of what is in store for them when they graduate.&quot;

In addition to career growth, Rosetta's internship program focuses on giving back to the local community each year. In 2013, Cleveland interns and team members volunteered with The Center for Families and Children. Mirroring a full-scale Rosetta project across cross-functional teams, interns worked together to improve the Center's website. By upgrading technical capabilities in online donating and relationship management as well as redesigning a portion of the Center's website, Rosetta donated more than 3,600 hours of time and approximately $434,000 worth of work through the internship program last year.
