Text: Publicis Groupe <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a> Rosetta today announced it has hired <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/alexander-ouvaroff/3/764/901">Alexander Ouvaroff</a> as Partner to lead the agency&rsquo;s Los Angeles office. Reporting to Managing Partner Grant McDougall, Ouvaroff will be charged with growing Rosetta&rsquo;s West Coast business across its Technology &amp; Telecommunications Industry Group and will lead account management for some of the agency&rsquo;s key Los Angeles-based clients.

Ouvaroff comes to Rosetta from Mindshare where he served as Managing Partner, Western Region Lead, and was responsible for overseeing all aspects of agency management and client partnerships on the West Coast. With nearly 20 years of experience developing multi-channel marketing solutions, Alexander&rsquo;s focus on customer engagement will allow him to lead Rosetta&rsquo;s Los Angeles office and expand its West Coast business while driving growth and innovation across the agency&rsquo;s global client roster. 

&ldquo;Alexander is widely-recognized as one of the true stars in our industry, with a consistent track record of building long-lasting and meaningful client relationships,&rdquo; said McDougall. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an ideal fit for our larger agency growth strategy and value proposition, which is based around marrying material business impact with meaningful human benefit. We&rsquo;re proud to welcome him to the Rosetta family.&rdquo;

Prior to his time at Mindshare, Ouvaroff held prominent roles in the industry such as Executive Vice President, Client Service Director at Marketing Evolution; Analytics and Insights Specialist at Anheauser-Busch InBev; and General Manager at Band Digital Inc.&rsquo;s LA office, where his client roster included the likes of Mountain Dew, Toyota, Harley-Davidson, Sony Entertainment and Paramount Pictures to name a few. Furthermore, Ouvaroff has held leadership roles at MRM//McCann and Red Bull. 

&ldquo;Rosetta&rsquo;s ability to deliver true customer engagement – through data-driven human insights, technology and next-generation storytelling – is light years ahead of the vanilla digital offerings from most agencies and drives consistent, measurable and lasting business growth for its clients,&rdquo; said Ouvaroff. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited to be joining the team and look forward to helping the agency establish a clear leadership position in the Los Angeles market.&rdquo;

In addition to the hire of Ouvaroff, the agency has aggressively added key leadership to support its rapidly growing global client list. Recent hires include:  Managing Partner Eric Healy; Executive Creative Director Europe Clare McDonald; UK Tech Lead Paul Smith; Global Chief Creative Officer Lars Bastholm; Chief Strategy Officer Scott Sorokin; and Chief Technology Officer Joe Lozito.
