Text: Publicis Groupe <a href="http://www.rosetta.com/">customer engagement agency</a> Rosetta today announced that it has appointed Ariel Marciano as its new Chief Financial Officer. Marciano brings Rosetta extensive experience in leading digital agency operations for numerous Publicis Groupe agencies, and positions the agency for an aggressive global expansion strategy. The agency opened its European headquarters in London last year and expects to open additional global locations within the next two years.

Marciano has developed strong ties to Publicis Groupe leadership over the course of a career that has included Chief Financial Officer assignments for ZenithOptimedia France, Starcom France, Vivaki France, Razorfish France, Digitas France and as Head of Group Consolidation for Publicis Groupe. Most recently he oversaw all financial operations for ZenithOptimedia France, Starcom France and Vivaki France, including team organization, improvement of agency profitability and cash generation, review of regional and global client contracts and delivering cost synergies between media entities in France. He also played a key role in the integration of both Digitas France and Razorfish France into Publicis Groupe after each was acquired.

Marciano takes over from Rich DeMilt who served as Chief Financial Officer for Rosetta since 2008 and helped guide the agency through a period of rapid growth, a number of key acquisitions and its assimilation into Publicis Groupe. Marciano will report directly to CEO Tom Adamski and functionally to Jean-Michel Etienne, Publicis Groupe CFO. He will be based in the agency’s Princeton, New Jersey office.

“Ariel’s proven record of leading financial and operational teams at global agencies, combined with his deep knowledge of the Publicis Groupe network, make him uniquely qualified to help lead the next stage of growth for Rosetta,” said Adamski. “I chose him for this role so that we can elevate the role of the CFO in our performance and involve him in shaping the operational fabric of our agency. I’m pleased to welcome him to the team.”

“I am delighted to be joining Rosetta at such an exciting stage in its evolution and look forward to being a part of its growth and expansion as the world’s leading customer engagement agency,” said Marciano.

Rosetta has made a number of key hires to its leadership team since Adamski took over as CEO in 2013, including Chief Strategy Officer Scott Sorokin, Chief Technology Officer Joe Lozito, Global Chief Creative Officer Lars Bastholm and Managing Partner Eric Healy. The agency is positioned to enter a period of rapid growth on the back of its proprietary engagement engine offering that integrates data, intelligence, customer experiences and optimization to create personalized engagement programs.

Marciano is a Certified Public Accountant in France and holds a Master’s degree in Accounting and Financial Controlling.
