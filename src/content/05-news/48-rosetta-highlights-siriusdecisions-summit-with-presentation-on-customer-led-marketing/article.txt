Rosetta joins the Summit as a Gold Level sponsor and will showcase its B2B Engagement Roadmap methodology, which helps global brands transform their business and drive customer engagement through a focus on their customers&rsquo; individual journeys. In addition to the roadmap, Rosetta will be sharing their proprietary Customer Engagement Engine, which is a framework being used by several global brands to integrate data, technology, experiences and optimization strategies.

The presentations will be led by Grant McDougall, Managing Partner of Rosetta&rsquo;s Technology &amp; Telecommunications vertical, and Laurent Gaubert, Director of Market Intelligence and Analytics at Autodesk. They are scheduled to take place on May 21, 2014 at 8:00-8:45 a.m. and 8:55-9:45 a.m. EDT. Both discussions will identify how marketers should use segmentation to capture and understand human behavior while building persona-based brand experiences that will drive impactful interactions.

&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s landscape, it&rsquo;s critical for brands to use human insights to build a customer-led approach to marketing and how we talk to customers,&rdquo; said McDougall. &ldquo;We are excited to be presenting alongside our client Autodesk, who is making great strides in doing all of these things.&rdquo;

The SiriusDecisions Summit is an annual event attended widely by senior level executives such as Chief Marketing Officers, Vice Presidents of Demand Generation, Corporate Communications, Sales Enablement and Channel Marketing. Attendees will receive SiriusDecisions&rsquo; latest research as well as current trends in B2B marketing. Rosetta will be located by Booth 59 and will be available to further discuss ways brands can use the B2B Engagement Roadmap in a customer-led approach.
