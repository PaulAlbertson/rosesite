Text: Rosetta, a Publicis Groupe customer engagement agency, today announced it has been featured in Digital Clarity Group’s 2014 Guide to Service Providers for Web Content and Customer Experience Management, North American Edition. This is the second consecutive year the agency has been highlighted as a leading agency in deploying robust web content management and technology solutions. 

“Managing customer experiences is hard, complicated, and new,” said Dr. Tim Walters, Partner and Principal Analyst, Digital Clarity Group. “Very few organizations have all of the resources necessary to deploy the technologies, formulate the strategies, and optimize the outcomes. Most companies should, and will, turn to external agencies to solve for this challenge.”

The guide highlights the Web Content Management partnerships and expertise of service providers, such as digital agencies and systems integrators, within the context of their evolving support for customer experience management. It also includes an assessment framework to aid in the evaluation and selection of partners. Rosetta was again recognized for its strong partnerships with IBM and Sitecore, as well as for its vender-agnostic consulting services for WCM projects. The report states, “Rosetta combines technology skills with its agency services, such as marketing strategy, brand planning, and social and analytics, making the company a potential fit for large technology projects that are integrated with broader commerce, personalized marketing, and loyalty campaigns.”

“The primary goal for most brands looking at web content and customer experience management solutions is to deliver more relevant experiences that meet the customers’ need,” said Rosetta’s Chief Technology Officer Joe Lozito. “We are proud to be featured in this report because of our ability to bring together the right combination of customer intelligence, personalized experiences and technology to make clients successful.” 

Digital Clarity Group’s CEO Scott Liewehr said, “Digital Clarity Group has been covering the deployment of content and engagement related technologies since our inception. And if there’s one rule that applies to every deployment of technology, it’s that the implementation is what sets every business on the road to success or failure. A great implementation partner is one of the primary keys to a successful customer engagement strategy.”
