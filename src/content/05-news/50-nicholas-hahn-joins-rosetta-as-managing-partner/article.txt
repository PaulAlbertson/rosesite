Text: Publicis Groupe (link: http://www.rosetta.com/ text: Customer Engagement Agency Rosetta) today announced it has hired Nicholas Hahn as Managing Partner to co-lead growth for Rosetta Consulting, a dedicated practice specializing in uncovering and activating human insights and intelligence to drive next-generation growth strategies. Rosetta Consulting contributes to customer engagement assignments on behalf of the agency’s clients, while also functioning as an independent business unit to provide growth strategy consulting services to its own growing roster of blue-chip clients around the globe.

Hahn will report directly to Chief Executive Officer Tom Adamski and partner with Managing Partner Jay Lichtenstein to lead global growth and expansion of Rosetta Consulting. He will be based in Rosetta’s New York Fifth Avenue office.

Hahn joins Rosetta from Vivaldi Partners, a global innovation and growth strategy consulting firm, where he was a Senior Partner and Managing Director. He has more than 29 years of experience advising companies such as: Coca-Cola, Nestle, Campbell’s Soup, Procter & Gamble, American Express, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, Del Monte, Wrigley, Quaker, Frito Lay, Con Agra, Absolut, Adidas, DirecTV, Volkswagen, Georgia Pacific, Ruth’s Chris, Perdue, Home Depot, Sears, Kenmore, Whirlpool and multiple start up brands.

“Nick has a proven track record of driving profitable growth and exceptional client delivery for a wide range of global clients and major industries, including consumer packaged goods, financial services, automotive and hospitality,” said Adamski. “His energy, imagination, drive and intellect make him a great fit for our agency and we’re thrilled to add another industry veteran to our rapidly growing leadership team.”

“I believe Rosetta is an agency primed for explosive growth—it uniquely combines a world-class, customer-centric strategic consulting capability with the ability to comprehensively activate and deliver on customer engagement, and then measure the impact,” said Hahn. “This end-to-end, customer-centric approach to driving and sustaining growth has direct applicability for brands across industries.”

Prior to his work at Vivaldi Partners, Hahn was a Global Director at The Coca-Cola Company, where he was responsible for strategic growth opportunity identification, new product development and global brand portfolio management. He developed Coke’s highly successful global bottled water strategy, ran its non-carbonated brands portfolio and was General Manager for Coke's interest in its joint venture with Nestle on tea and coffee.
