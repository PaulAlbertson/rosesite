Text: Publicis Groupe customer engagement agency Rosetta today released the first of three white papers based on the 2014 Rosetta Consulting Customer Engagement Survey. Fielded by Rosetta Consulting – an industry-leading consulting practice specializing in uncovering human insights and intelligence to drive next-generation marketing strategies – this research examined marketers’ approaches to customer engagement, as well as the value that engagement delivered to the bottom line.

One of the most striking results from the survey was that companies that were “strong performers” (those that were the in the top third of the sample in terms of following best practices for customer engagement) reported better business metrics than those that did not. 86% of strong performers in customer engagement saw an increase in the previous year’s revenue, while only half of others did. In addition, strong performers were 2.2 times more likely than others to have experienced an increase in market share in the past year.

Key Findings:

- 89% of strong performers say that success is driven by best-in-class customer experience vs. 32% of others
- Strong performers are 3.8 times more likely than others to say that they are able to identify where each customer is on the customer journey
- Strong performers are 6 times more likely than others to leverage real-time data to customize marketing efforts
- Strong performers are 5 times more likely than others to say that customer data is automatically analyzed and informs business decisions

“Delivering successful customer engagement is critical in today's fast-paced, evolving marketing landscape,” said Rosetta Consulting Managing Partner Jay Lichtenstein. “Our research shows that successful brands collect a tremendous amount of information about who their customers are and the drivers behind their behavior. They then use this intelligence to constantly refine strategies and tactics, creating the valuable, relevant brand experiences that customers crave.”

####Methodology

Rosetta Consulting polled 87 marketers and senior executives across industries about their approach to customer engagement. Each company was assessed on a broad range of best practice areas, including culture, capabilities, data and insights, measurement, strategy and technology. Companies scoring in the top third of the sample were designated “strong performers.” Industries included healthcare, financial services, consumer goods, technology, retail, food and beverage, and hospitality.

####Next Steps

In addition to research on how marketers view customer engagement, Rosetta Consulting surveyed customers about their experiences and what they value when interacting with a brand. The group will soon release a second white paper presenting those results, as well as a third paper combining the perspectives to quantify the value of customer engagement.

####Available Resources

Rosetta Consulting has developed a white paper with a comprehensive analysis of the study’s results, as well as an infographic with key findings.
