Text: Rosetta, a (link:/ text: customer engagement agency) within the Publicis Groupe, today announced it has been awarded LEED, or Leadership in Energy & Environment Design, certification from the U.S. Green Building Council for its West Coast hub in San Luis Obispo, California. Rosetta opened the new two-story, 48,000-square-foot building in April 2013, which today houses nearly 200 team members across customer intelligence, technology and experiences. The agency is one of the largest employers in San Luis Obispo and continues to serve an integral role in the local business community.

LEED is a green building certification program designed to recognize best-in-class sustainable building strategies and practices. To obtain certification, a building project must satisfy stringent prerequisites and earn points to achieve different levels of certification. Locally designed by Garcia Architecture + Design and built by J.W. Design & Construction in conjunction with NKT Commercial LLC, the San Luis Obispo facility received high marks for its implementation of energy-efficiency materials, including: highly insulated SIP exterior wall system, translucent vertical wall panels, and efficient lighting projected to use 17% less energy than a standard building, as well as water conserving fixtures, showers and landscaping slated to save 300,000 gallons of water per year. In addition, more than 20% of the materials used were recycled materials produced regionally, including concrete, plants, carpet and paving. During construction, the building was also mechanically ventilated to exceed ASHRAE standards.

“Our San Luis Obispo office represents Rosetta’s desire to build a long-term, meaningful presence in the local community while providing our team members with a state-of-the-art environment that enables them to excel and drive some of the most innovative work of our time. We’re proud to call it home,” said Rosetta’s Chief Executive Officer Tom Adamski.
“From the beginning,” noted architect George Garcia, AIA, “our design team was challenged to envision a facility that not only reflected Rosetta’s strong philosophy of environmental stewardship, but also synthesized the agency’s creative and collaborative culture into a sustainable and dynamic work environment.”

Rosetta’s San Luis Obispo office has also implemented several programs for sustainable operations, including a comprehensive transportation management plan to reduce single-vehicle trips, a green cleaning program, sustainable landscape management, including integrated pest control, and sustainable hardscape management.

In addition to the environmentally friendly architecture, the office includes a state-of-the-art video and motion graphics design studio that enables the agency to create engaging brand experiences for their clients across web, mobile, social media and television platforms. This lab is used by the agency to develop new online and offline payment methods, uncover insights about consumer and business buyer behavior, and create unique opportunities for the brands to interact with their customers.
