According to SIGNL, it “calculates Momentum Scores for over one million companies by aggregating, quantifying, and cross-referencing modern data such as web traffic, media coverage, app downloads, and social buzz—as well as more traditional business data, like hiring patterns and income.” SIGNL analyzed more than 1,100 advertising agencies in July 2014 before ranking the top performers.

Rosetta has been on a hiring spree since Tom Adamski took over as Chief Executive Officer in 2013, adding a number of key leadership hires, including: Chief Strategy Officer Scott Sorokin, Chief Technology Officer Joe Lozito, Global Chief Creative Officer Lars Bastholm, Chief Financial Officer Ariel Marciano, Managing Partner Eric Healy and Managing Partner Nicholas Hahn.

The agency is positioned to enter a period of rapid growth and global expansion on the back of its proprietary engagement engine offering that integrates data, intelligence, customer experiences and optimization to create personalized engagement programs.

It was the first agency to connect IBM WebSphere Commerce and Adobe Web Experience Manager to enable marketers to use customer profile data to personalize web sites and promotional content. Rosetta was also recently recognized by Digital Clarity Report for its web content and customer experience management capabilities.
