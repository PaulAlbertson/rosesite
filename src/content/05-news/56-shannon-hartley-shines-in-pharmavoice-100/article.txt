Text: Publicis Groupe customer engagement agency Rosetta today announced Shannon Hartley, Managing Partner and Healthcare Industry Group Leader, has been featured in the 2014 edition of PharmaVoice 100, which recognizes the most inspiring people in the life-sciences industry. Those chosen for this elite group are leaders in research and development, marketing, technology, creativity, strategy and medicine.

Hartley joined the agency in 2006 as a partner in its leading Rosetta Consulting practice. In 2012, she was elevated to lead the Healthcare Industry Group and quickly set the tone for a new era of leadership, while shifting the agency’s positioning around the idea of customer engagement and creating integrated physician and patient engagement programs for some of the world’s most influential pharmaceutical brands.

Additionally, Hartley led Rosetta’s development of the first iPad app within the pharma industry, which has enabled the agency to drive business impact for its clients with insight-driven, innovative marketing programs that support sales, internal communications, relationship marketing, and convention engagement across the healthcare field. Hartley also established an outpost in London for a key client, which led to the agency’s 2013 opening of Rosetta Europe.

"Shannon is a vital part of Rosetta’s leadership and the healthcare industry as a whole," said Chief Executive Officer Tom Adamski. "Her strategic planning and oversight have led to important new account wins, the launch of numerous new pharmaceutical brands, and a return to near double-digit growth for Rosetta’s healthcare practice. She is a true innovator and role model, and well deserving of this recognition."

Prior to joining Rosetta, Hartley held the role of senior director in neuroscience global market research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, and has a Bachelor of Science degree from Miami University. In addition to her work in healthcare, she is dedicated to mentoring the next generation of industry leaders and actively gives back to the community through her involvement in Publicis Viva Women!; the Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association; the National MS Society, Princeton Junior School; and the Junior League of Greater Princeton.
