Text: Publicis Groupe (link: / text: customer engagement agency) Rosetta today announced that Managing Partner Paul Elliott will address the (link: http://www.gdsinternational.com/events/ngretail/us/ text: Next Generation Retail Summit US target: blank) with a presentation titled “Avoiding the Retail Graveyard – The Customer Engagement Imperative.” The conference will take place September 16-18, 2014 in Miami, FL.

The NG Retail Summit is an exclusive, invitation-only digital commerce conference, bringing together innovative retailers with top solution providers. Sessions will cover a broad range of omni-channel topics, including: mobile marketing, customer centricity, the social path to purchase, and eCommerce.

Elliott’s presentation will clarify the difference between disruption and innovation, and demonstrate why many retailers are missing the mark despite their best intentions. He will explain how brands can survive in a constantly changing marketplace by focusing on the needs of their best customers and paying attention to the threats posed by more agile and entrepreneurial competitors.

"Succeeding, let a lone thriving, in today’s retail climate is more difficult than ever," said Elliott. "Retailers need to make smart and prioritized investments to avoid being overtaken by industry disruptors and agile innovators."

Paul Elliott is the Managing Partner in charge of client strategy for Rosetta's Consumer Products & Retail industry vertical, which includes the agency's Hospitality clients. He is a thought leader in digital and omni-channel strategies, and founded and led the agency's Paid, Owned, and Earned Media group for six years. Elliott has nearly 15 years of experience in helping marquee brands achieve significant business results and return on investment from their digital marketing initiatives. He is a nationally recognized speaker, including the keynote address at Marriott's 2014 Digital Summit in New York and social and mobile panel participation last year in Boston.
