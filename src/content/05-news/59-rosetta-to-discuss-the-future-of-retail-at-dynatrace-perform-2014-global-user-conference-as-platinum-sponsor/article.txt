Text: Rosetta, Publicis Groupe's (link: / text: customer engagement agency), today announced that Jonathan Morgan, Director of User Experience, will present a keynote session titled *“The Future of Retail – Transforming Commerce for the Connected World”* at the Dynatrace (formerly Compuware APM) PERFORM 2014 Global User Conference in Orlando, Florida. Rosetta will be participating in this year’s conference as a Platinum-level sponsor. 

In his presentation, Morgan will discuss why today’s retailers have to place a greater focus on technology, including new generation APM, to create omni-channel experiences in order to retain customers and gain market share. The session is scheduled to take place from 9:00-9:45 a.m. EDT on October 8, 2014, and will include information on how Rosetta uses Dynatrace solutions to optimize performance and business results for their customers.

“We’ve entered a new era of technology that now gives brands the opportunity to create a deeper level of engagement with their customers than ever before,” said Morgan. “Retailers must seamlessly couple experiences and technology, with a consistent brand message beginning at the storefront and extending across all channels.”

“We are pleased to have Rosetta as a Platinum sponsor of PERFORM 2014.  Attendees will benefit from Rosetta’s expertise in creating brand interactions with superior performance,” said Todd Kaloudis, VP of Worldwide Partner Sales, Dynatrace.

The theme for this year’s PERFORM Conference is “Success in the Era of the Hyper-Connected Customer,” and the three-day event will feature real-world examples of how companies use Dynatrace to optimize users’ experiences online, drive profits and build business success.
