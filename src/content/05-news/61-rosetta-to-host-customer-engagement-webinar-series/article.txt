Publicis Groupe (link: / text: customer engagement agency) Rosetta today announced it will host a webinar series geared toward brands that are interested in shifting their marketing strategy from one-off campaigns to ongoing cycles of customer engagement.

The first webinar will be led by Head of Rosetta Consulting Jay Lichtenstein. Lichtenstein will share proprietary data gathered by the agency’s Consulting practice, which identifies behavior types of highly engaged customers across industry groups. He will also introduce a three-part framework that can be used by brand marketers to identify and segment their best customers; build an actionable journey map to reach target audiences; and align teams around the most critical engagement points. 

**Session Title:** *Who and How to Engage – Aligning the Business Around Your Best Customers*<br>
**Speaker:** Jay Lichtenstein, Head of Rosetta Consulting<br>
**Date:** October 15, 2014<br>
**Time:** 1:00-2:00 p.m. EST<br>

According to data collected in the (link: http://www.rosetta.com/customer-engagement-report text: 2014 Rosetta Consulting Customer Engagement Survey), highly engaged customers are likely to spend 33% more per transaction and are six times more likely to be loyal to a brand. The webinar series will highlight survey findings, and will provide marketers with real-life examples of how ongoing engagement is effective across industries. 

The next scheduled session will be held on November 12 and will discuss ways brands can connect disparate technology systems into a singular engagement engine that delivers contextually relevant content.
