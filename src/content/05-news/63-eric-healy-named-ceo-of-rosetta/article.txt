Publicis Groupe (link: / text: customer engagement agency) Rosetta today announced that Eric Healy has been named Chief Executive Officer of the agency and will now oversee all business units across Rosetta’s nine U.S. and European locations. 

Healy, who was promoted from Managing Partner of Rosetta’s Consumer Products & Retail Industry Group, will also sit on the Brand Leadership team of Razorfish Global and report to Razorfish Global CEO Tom Adamski. 

As Managing Partner, Healy led a team of more than 223 professionals that specialize in delivering omni-channel strategy and experience-driven commerce solutions on behalf of global brands in the retail and hospitality sectors. With Healy’s oversight, the industry group has grown 44.5% year to date and added seven marquee brands to its growing client roster, which represents 29% of the agency’s total revenues.  

Prior to joining Rosetta in February 2014, Healy served as vice president at SapientNitro, where he led a wide range of multi-channel marketing, commerce and technology engagements on behalf of Fortune 500 clients from the agency’s Boston office. Healy also served as executive vice president, corporate development, and network director for Aegis, plc, and before that he held senior leadership roles at Mullen, Arnold Worldwide, Digitas and Reebok International Limited. 

“Since joining Rosetta earlier this year, Eric has proven to be a strong, results-oriented leader, and his acumen and track record leading successful teams makes him the ideal fit for this role,” said Adamski. “Under his leadership, I expect Rosetta to accelerate its already strong growth trajectory, and I am pleased to welcome him to the Razorfish Global Brand Leadership team.” 

Publicis Groupe announced the formation of Razorfish Global on September 16. The network combines Razorfish’s technology and creative user experience strengths with Rosetta’s customer intelligence capabilities to help clients drive business transformation on a global scale.

The Razorfish Global Leadership team was announced earlier this week and includes: Tom Adamski, Chief Executive Officer; Ariel Marciano, Chief Financial Officer; Alicia Shankland, Chief Talent Officer; Scott Sorokin, Chief Strategy Officer; William Lidstone, Chief Marketing Officer; Ray Velez, Chief Technology Officer; and Daniel Bonner, Chief Creative Officer.

The network’s Brand Leadership team sits under the Global Leadership team and is comprised of the leaders of each individual agency within Razorfish Global. Other leaders on the Brand team include: Shannon Denton, Razorfish North America; Michael Karg, Razorfish International; and Dan Connolly, LEVEL Studios.

On the recent appointment Healy said, “Rosetta’s core strengths in customer intelligence, technology and experience have allowed us to deliver material business impact for our clients and forge meaningful relationships for brands and their customers. Our capabilities as part of the Razorfish Global network make us an unrivaled business partner, and it’s a tremendous honor to be asked to serve as the agency's brand leader. I’m passionate about this organization, and I look forward to working with a world-class team to chart a new era of growth and development."
