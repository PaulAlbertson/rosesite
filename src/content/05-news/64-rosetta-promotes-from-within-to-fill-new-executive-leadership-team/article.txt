Publicis Groupe (link: / text: customer engagement agency) Rosetta, which recently became part of the new Razorfish Global network, today announced new appointments to its Executive and Operating Leadership Teams.

In September, Rosetta Chief Executive Officer Tom Adamski was tapped by Publicis Groupe to serve as CEO of Razorfish Global, a new network created to combine Razorfish's strengths in technology, media and creative/user experience with Rosetta's customer intelligence capabilities to drive business transformation on a global scale. Rosetta’s Chief Strategy Officer Scott Sorokin and Chief Financial Officer Ariel Marciano were also named to the Razorfish Global Leadership Team.

Last week, Rosetta announced that Eric Healy had been named Chief Executive Officer. Today’s announcement reflects a swift and decisive move by Healy to lock in his leadership teams and capitalize on Rosetta’s strong growth and momentum over the last year.

Effective immediately, Rosetta’s Executive Committee includes:

- Eric Healy, Chief Executive Officer 
- Nigel Adams, Chief Talent Officer 
- Tammy Soares, Rosetta West Lead 
- Drew Kurth, Rosetta East Lead 
- Sebastian Dreyfus, Rosetta Europe Lead
- Mark Eckman, Delivery & Operations 
- Joe Lozito, Chief Technology Officer & Solutions Lead 
- Andy DeNecochea, Finance Lead

Each leader will report directly to Healy.

Adams is the only holdover from Rosetta’s previous Executive Committee. His title and role remain the same. Soares was previously a Managing Partner in Rosetta’s Technology & Telecommunications Industry Group. Kurth was previously a Partner in Rosetta’s Consumer Products & Retail Industry Group. Dreyfus will continue to lead Rosetta Europe in addition to his appointment to the Executive Committee. Eckman was previously a Managing Partner in Rosetta’s Consumer Products & Retail Industry Group. Lozito will continue his role leading Technology and will also oversee all Rosetta solutions, in addition to his appointment to the Executive Committee. DeNecochea was previously a Partner in Rosetta’s Finance and Operations business unit.

Healy also named new members to Rosetta’s Operating Committee, which is responsible for operationalizing the growth strategy set forth by the Executive Committee. The newly appointed team will report into Healy and is comprised of:

- Alex Mahernia, Chief Creative Officer 
- David Worth, Global Strategic Planning
- Eli Grant, Growth Operations 
- Paul Elliott, Innovation & Thought Leadership 
- Nick Hahn, Rosetta Consulting 
- Joe Lozito, Chief Technology Officer & Solutions Lead 
- Jason Tabeling, Paid Owned and Earned Media 
- Mike Chenelle, Agency Operations 
- Kim McFetridge, People & Culture

“Rosetta has been one of the strongest performing digital agencies within all of Publicis Groupe over the last year,” said Healy. “A number of major client wins, combined with our unique value proposition as an agency able to deliver customer engagement through a combination of customer intelligence, technology and experience make us a formidable player on the global stage,” said Healy. “I’m thrilled to welcome each of these individuals to the leadership team and look forward to our continued success and growth.”
