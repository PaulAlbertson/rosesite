Rosetta, a Publicis Groupe and Razorfish Global (link: / text: customer engagement agency), today announced it has partnered with Cleveland’s The Centers for Families and Children (The Centers) to design and implement a full digital engagement strategy for The Learning Coalition, a group of local high quality preschool providers dedicated to preparing children for kindergarten. The project was completed by the agency’s summer interns and included website development, social media strategy and video and motion graphics design.

As part of Rosetta’s annual college internship program, students work with local non-profit organizations on real-life assignments designed to increase their skillsets and provide on-the-job training. This year, 40 Rosetta interns across six offices teamed up with The Centers to develop actionable marketing strategies for The Learning Coalition, a federally-funded collaborative launched in 2013.

“The value of Rosetta’s college internship program is two-fold because we get first-class digital marketing services and expertise while the students get incredible experience and exposure by helping clients solve real world business and marketing challenges,” said Elizabeth Newman, Chief Operating Officer for The Centers.

“Our strong partnership with The Centers has become a critical component of our summer programming for Rosetta’s college interns,” said Shawn Cornelius, Partner of Rosetta and member of The Centers’ board. “In addition to building their technical, creative, and marketing acumen, this project also fostered critical skills for our interns including teamwork, leadership, project management and time management.”

In addition to completing The Centers’ project, Rosetta interns had the opportunity to work on agency client work under the supervision of a mentor. The agency’s College Recruiting team also provided interns with professional development training on career development and accepting feedback constructively.

Halley Marsh, Rosetta’s Director of Talent Acquisition said, “The summer project creates challenges for our students that they do not have the opportunity to see in the classroom. Our interns encounter the type of real client requests that Rosetta handles on a daily basis, as well as the added difficulty of working with fellow interns located in three different time zones. These challenges have enabled leaders to rise among our group of interns.”
