Rosetta, the Publicis Groupe (link: / text: customer engagement agency) and a member of Razorfish Global network, today released the second in a series of three white papers based on the 2014 Rosetta Consulting Customer Engagement Survey. Fielded by Rosetta Consulting – an industry-leading consulting practice specializing in uncovering human insights and intelligence to drive next-generation marketing strategies – this research examined how profitable customers engage with a brand, as well as the value that engagement delivered to the bottom line.

One of the most striking results from the survey was that highly engaged customers are three times more valuable than other customers over the course of a year. This is because they buy 90% more frequently and spend 60% more in each transaction.

“True engagement goes beyond satisfaction or loyalty – it is a deep, mutually beneficial relationship between a brand and a customer,” said Nick Hahn, Managing Partner of Rosetta Consulting. “While many marketers have long intuited that the engaged customer is the ideal customer, we now have a better understanding of the elements that foster engagement and how engagement drives value and economic benefit.”

##Key Findings:

- Highly engaged customers were 5 times more likely than others to say “this is the only brand I would choose”
- Highly engaged customers were 6 times more likely to believe “this brand is worth more than I pay for it”
- 88% of highly engaged customers state that they are “passionate about this brand” vs. just 8% of others
- Highly engaged customers were 6 times more likely to say that they would “try a new product or service from the brand as soon as it becomes available”
- Highly engaged customers were 7 times more likely to “always respond to this brand’s promotional offers”

##Methodology

Rosetta Consulting polled 4,800 consumers about their experiences with 83 market-leading brands in 15 industries. Highly engaged consumers were identified using a predictive  scoring mechanism that selected the respondents that best demonstrated a broad range of key engagement characteristics, including advocacy, loyalty, and increased transaction and interaction rates, as well as positive feelings and experiences associated with the brand.

##The Customer Engagement White Paper Series

In addition to research on how consumers experience customer engagement, Rosetta Consulting surveyed brands about their customer engagement methods and strategies, and released those findings in its first white paper. A third paper will combine the perspectives of both marketers and customers to quantify the value of customer engagement.
