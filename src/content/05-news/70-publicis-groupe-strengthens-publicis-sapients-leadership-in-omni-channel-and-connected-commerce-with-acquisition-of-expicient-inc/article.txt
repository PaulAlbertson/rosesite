**Publicis Groupe [Euronext Paris: FR0000130577, CAC40]** has acquired Expicient Inc. (Expicient), a leading global omni-channel services firm with significant expertise in inventory and order management systems (OMS), a capability that clients increasingly need to manage inventory, pricing and offers across channels for today’s connected consumer who moves fluidly across digital and physical stores. Expicient will be integrated into the (link: http://www.publicis.sapient.com/en-us/index.html text: Publicis.Sapient target: _blank) platform under the Rosetta brand. 

“Today’s always-on consumer makes no distinction between devices and channels,” said Publicis.Sapient CEO Alan Herrick “as a result our retail clients are increasingly looking for us to build systems&mdash;inventory, supply chain, omni-channel commerce that enable the experience a 2015 consumer demands. (link: http://www.publicis.sapient.com/en-us/index.html text: Expicient joining Publicis.Sapient target: _blank) allows us to significantly strengthen our clients ability to integrate offer information, order information, inventory information and pricing information across channels, which is a significant change from a world where the on-line stores and physical stores operated separately.” 

Expicient’s industry-leading omni-channel Order Management Systems (OMS) capabilities and strong expertise in managed services, inbound/outbound supply chain, logistics, in-store clienteling applications and strategic technology consulting will strengthen Publicis.Sapient’s marketing, commerce and consulting offerings. In joining the Publicis.Sapient platform, Expicient will be lead by the Rosetta team and will contribute to Publicis.Sapient’s Global Distributed Delivery model, whereby the platform creates significant shared service capabilities accessible to all its clients. 

“Rosetta is perfectly positioned to lead the integration of Expicient and help accelerate the benefit for Publicis.Sapient clients,” said Tom Adamski CEO Razorfish Global. “SapientNitro, Razorfish Global and DigitasLBi are all highly recognized as leaders in omni-channel commerce, and together through the Publicis.Sapient platform we are unmatched. Expicient’s impact on our total business will be significant.”

The announcement comes weeks after Publicis Groupe announced the completion of the Sapient acquisition and the formation of Publicis.Sapient. (link: http://www.publicis.sapient.com/en-us/index.html text: Publicis.Sapient is the world’s most forward leaning target: blank) and largest digitally centered platform focused exclusively on digital transformation and the dynamics of an always-on world. The creation of Publicis.Sapient combines global leaders SapientNitro, Razorfish Global, Rosetta and DigitasLBi, with the deep industry expertise of Sapient Consulting. 

Expicient and Publicis.Sapient brands SapientNitro, Razorfish Global and Rosetta have previously collaborated on a number of global omni-channel commerce assignments with clients, including Staples, Target, Kroger, Fast Retailing, Marks & Spencer, Belk and Ralph Lauren. The agencies expect to quickly and seamlessly merge delivery capabilities and increase the value that can be offered to clients. Expicient’s capabilities will be shared across the Publicis.Sapient platform so that all clients benefit. As a result of the acquisition, Publicis.Sapient will now have the deepest OMS offering in the market, with expertise in IBM/Sterling, Manhattan and SAP/hybris.

“The opportunity ahead of us, to create differentiated customer experiences is tremendous. We are living in an unprecedented time of connected consumers and commerce. For Expicient, combining forces with Publicis.Sapient will allow our teams to deliver a full range of marketing and commerce solutions while significantly expanding our global reach,” said Darpan Seth CEO and founder of Expicient. “We’re excited to be a part of Publicis.Sapient and to meaningfully add to global commerce capabilities already recognized as the best in the world.”

Founded in 2008, Expicient is based in Andover, Massachusetts, with additional offices in the United Kingdom and India, in Gurgaon and Bangalore, where Publicis.Sapient also has a significant presence.
