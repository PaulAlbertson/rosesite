Visitors to SapientNitro’s booth will also get an early look at a new customer engagement kiosk that provides rich, digital content to lure customers into the store and create an engaging, dynamic shopping experience. The kiosk, which was jointly developed with Demandware, uses iBeacon technology to identify shoppers and personalize content that appears on the screen, including promotional items and new arrivals.
