Rosetta, the world’s leading (link: / text: customer engagement agency), today announced it will headline NG Retail Summit US with a keynote presentation showcasing its innovation and thought leadership in omni-channel retail. Rosetta will participate as a gold-level sponsor at this year’s event, which kicks off May 4th in Miami, Florida.
 
Rosetta’s Executive Vice President of Marketing & Innovation Paul Elliott will take center stage May 5 from 8:10 &ndash; 8:50 a.m. EDT with a keynote session titled “Retail: A Race to the Bottom.” Elliott will discuss the increasing role of digital and the need for retailers to deploy personalized and contextually relevant experiences in order to satisfy the needs of today’s digitally empowered consumers. He’ll outline a new retail playbook and explore how brands can leverage data-driven insights and innovative technology solutions to drive revenues both in-store and online.

“Engaged customers are the best customers&mdash;they purchase and spend more, advocate more, and remain more loyal, yet retailers today are struggling to achieve this level of engagement,” said Elliott. “Promotional discounts are typically not the answer. They are just furthering the race to the bottom, where retailers struggle with profit and economic viability. Instead, it’s critical that retailers create compelling new reasons to get shoppers in the store and then deliver personalized interactions at every step of the customer journey.”

Steve Libenson, Partner in Rosetta Consulting, will also lead a workshop focused on the economics of customer engagement. Libenson’s working session titled “Engagement Economics: Justifying Your Focus on Customer Engagement” will take place on Tuesday, May 5 from 11:15 &ndash; 11:45 a.m. EDT and will illustrate how a customer-centric approach to selling provides mutual value for consumers and retailers. According to Libenson, “Successfully engaging with customers in today’s hyper-connected and technology-driven world is both a challenge and an opportunity. To succeed, marketers must understand the new value exchange that exists between customers and brands, and generate engagement that drives competitive advantage and profitable growth.”

Rosetta, part of the Razorfish Global network and the Publicis.Sapient platform, will showcase its (link: /news/sapientnitro-and-rosetta-headline-demandware-xchange-conference text: recently unveiled) In-Store Customer Engagement (ICE) solution that helps retailers better understand, predict and serve in-store customers.

The NG Retail Summit US is an exclusive retail conference that brings together decision makers, business leaders and solution providers to solve key business challenges in the retail space. This year’s summit will take place May 4&ndash;6, and will focus on “Understanding the Agile Connected Business in the 21st Century and Beyond,” and will explore the need for brands to innovate and reevaluate the relationship between digital and brick-and-mortar retail to realize omni-channel success.
