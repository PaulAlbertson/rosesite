In this new role, Winsell will be tasked with driving strategic innovation across the customer engagement ecosystem to create growth for Rosetta’s global client roster. He will be based at Rosetta’s New York 99 Hudson Street office, and will report to Executive Vice President of Global Strategic Planning David Worth.

Winsell comes to Rosetta most recently from The Experts Bench, Inc. where he served as senior marketing consultant to YP, the listing directory formally known as Yellow Pages. In this role, he was responsible for translating vision into action plans and roadmaps for the national marketing team, created go-to-market strategies and helped establish market positioning for new digital products while leading national sales training programs. He brings with him more than 20 years of marketing, content and brand strategy expertise, and has experience deeply rooted in agency account leadership, digital strategy and business development.

“Jon’s approach to strategy perfectly aligns with Rosetta’s strengths in combining intelligence, experience, and technology to grow our clients’ business through customer engagement,” said Worth. “He has a strong track record driving significant net new revenue and ROI for clients, and will play an instrumental role in strategic innovation for Rosetta. We’re thrilled to welcome him into our family.”

Prior to his time at The Experts Bench, Winsell held senior strategy and consultant roles at TMP Directional Marketing, MediaCom, VML Inc., Team Detroit and Carat USA. Over the course of his career, he’s worked with several leading global brands including American Express, L’Oreal, Ford Motor Company, Diageo, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, P&G and others. He has directed social media initiatives and integrated digital programs; led SaaS business development programs that doubled revenue in less than 18 months; managed digital and media budgets ranging from $1MM to $40MM; and took a technology startup company from zero to $1.8MM in revenue in 12 months.

“Throughout my career thus far, I have been an evangelist of customer engagement and I’m excited to be joining an organization that’s obsessed with empowering brands to drive deeper levels of engagement with their customers,” said Winsell.

Winsell holds a Masters of Russian Literature and Slavic Linguistics from the University of Texas at Austin, as well as a bachelor degree in Business and International Relations from the University of Oklahoma at Norman.
