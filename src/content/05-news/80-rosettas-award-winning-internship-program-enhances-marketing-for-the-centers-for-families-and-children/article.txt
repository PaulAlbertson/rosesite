Rosetta, the world’s leading agency focused on (link: / text: customer engagement), today announced it has partnered with Cleveland’s Centers for Families and Children (The Centers) for the fifth summer to redesign and develop a new user experience strategy. The project was completed by the agency’s 2015 summer interns and included website development, social media strategy and SEO initiatives.

As part of Rosetta’s annual college internship program, students worked with local non-profit organizations on real-life assignments designed to increase their skillsets and provide on-the-job training. This year, 50 Rosetta interns across five offices teamed up with The Centers in the redesign, development, testing, and launch of a new user experience at <a href="http://www.thecentersohio.org" target="_blank">www.thecentersohio.org</a> focused on current and prospective clients. The internship program is organized each year by Rosetta’s College Recruiting Team.

“The Centers is honored to partner with Rosetta and work with students as they actively leverage their expertise to solve real-world marketing challenges. The project completed this summer through Rosetta’s College Internship Program has an immediate impact in better connecting our clients to critical services and increasing awareness of our work in the community,” said Elizabeth Newman, President and CEO for The Centers.

“The Centers has become a central component to our summer programming for our college interns,” said Shawn Cornelius, partner at Rosetta and member of The Centers’ Board. “Year after year, this project fosters critical skills such as project management, leadership, teamwork, and time management. Not only are our interns giving back to the community, but they are building their technical, creative and marketing acumen while they do it.”

In addition to completing The Centers’ project, Rosetta interns had the opportunity to receive professional training on accepting feedback, career development and had the opportunity to learn about each business unit within the agency. Additionally, interns contributed to agency client work under mentor supervision.

Halley Marsh, Rosetta’s director of talent acquisition, said: “The summer project gives students an opportunity that they are not able to receive in the classroom. Not only are our interns working on real client work for Rosetta, but they are also given the challenge to complete a project across 5 different office locations. These challenges have enabled leaders to rise among our group of interns.”
