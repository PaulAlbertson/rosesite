(link: / text: Rosetta), the world’s leading agency focused on customer engagement and part of the Razorfish Global network, today announced it has hired Ed Falconer to lead its Analytics and Optimization (A&O) practice as senior vice president. Falconer will be based in Rosetta’s New York Tribeca office, and will report directly to Executive Vice President of Strategy David Worth.

In this role, Falconer will lead a team of more than thirty A&O specialists across North America and will be responsible for further bringing to market a compelling offering, fueled by data and customer insights, that supports the agency’s ability to drive deeper, more profitable levels of customer engagement on behalf of its portfolio of blue-chip clients.  At the agency’s core is a deep understanding of the customer that translates into personalized and contextually relevant experiences, with data and analytics being a key driver. In addition to his leadership role at Rosetta, Falconer will also serve as a key member of Razorfish Global’s industry leading data sciences team, which is part of the Publicis.Sapient platform.

“We’re at a pivotal time where clients recognize the need to put the customer at the center of their business model and want a trusted partner with strengths in customer understanding, data, and optimization to help them transform their business to be customer centric.  This transformation allows our clients to achieve stronger growth by more successfully bringing new products and services to market,” said Worth. “Ed is a true visionary and industry leader in this space, and will be a driving force in creating new opportunities for growth on behalf of our clients and agency.”

Falconer’s experience is deeply rooted in strategy, analytics and consulting, and he has built several high performing teams in the U.S., U.K., and Australia. He comes to Rosetta most recently from OgilvyOne, where he served as executive director of marketing analytics and was the head of analytics for OgilvyOne New York. In this role, he was responsible for delivering strategic data driven solutions for clients across multiple industries.

On joining the agency, Falconer noted: “The work Rosetta is delivering in relationship marketing and customer engagement strategy is changing the landscape of traditional loyalty programs, and I’m thrilled to build on an already strong foundation and work with a world-class team.”

Prior to his time at OgilvyOne, Falconer has held several senior marketing strategy and analytic roles at National Australia Bank, Myer Department Store, and data driven marketing consultancy Torque Solutions, among others. He has worked with a robust client list including Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG), British Airways, eBay, Qantas, Weight Watchers, IKEA and Luxottica Retail, and is credited with helping these brands become customer centric through the use of data analysis, data driven strategy and loyalty programs.

With more than 20 years of experience in data driven marketing, Falconer holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Sheffield Hallam University, along with a DipDM from The Institute of Direct and Digital Marketing.
