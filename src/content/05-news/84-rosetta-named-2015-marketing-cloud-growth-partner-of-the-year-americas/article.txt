Rosetta, the world’s leading agency focused on (link: / text: customer engagement) from Razorfish, today announced it has been named the 2015 Marketing Cloud Growth Partner of the Year-Americas. The award was presented Monday, March 21 at the Global Partner Awards ceremony at Adobe Summit in Las Vegas.

Adobe’s Marketing Cloud Growth Partner of the Year award recognizes a top-performing partner for their success in driving joint opportunities, year-over-year growth, and commitment to technical innovation. Rosetta was chosen for the award due to its proven ability to leverage the power of Adobe’s solutions to deliver customer engagement. The agency’s expertise in creating engagement ecosystems enables Adobe clients to discover data-driven strategic insights and deliver contextually relevant omni-channel experiences at scale across all stages of the customer lifecycle.

“Rosetta's ability to build unique IP on top of Adobe Marketing Cloud to create a customer-centric view, drive multi-solution deals, and truly partner with us throughout the engagement process has led to Rosetta’s software attribution hitting triple digit year-over-year increase,” said Vice President of Global Agency Partnerships at Adobe Jim Sink. “We are honored to award them this distinguished recognition, and look forward to delivering incremental growth and measurable, impactful value for our joint clients over the next year and beyond.”

The agency has successfully deployed Adobe Marketing Cloud on behalf of several well-known brands, creating a truly engaged ecosystem by leveraging insights to create experiences delivered through Adobe solutions. Most notably, Rosetta brought Adobe technologies to life by allowing one consumer product manufacturer to create a more engaging, content rich purchase experience online that opened up a new digital revenue channel. Furthermore, Rosetta has used Adobe Marketing Cloud to deliver highly personalized experiences to millions of users across the product lifecycle.

The award comes on the heels of Publicis Groupe and its digital transformation platform
Publicis.Sapient, which includes Rosetta and Razorfish, being named Adobe’s 2015 Digital Marketing Partner of the Year, demonstrating a strong track record of recognition from Adobe. In 2015, the agency was further recognized at Adobe EMEA Summit with the Rosetta Connector being recognized as Adobe’s 2015 EMEA Partner Solution of the Year. The Connector, which connects the world-class capabilities of Adobe Experience Manager with IBM WebSphere Commerce, delivers an enterprise-class offering to marketing and IT departments to manage and optimize the commerce and content ecosystem, from brand engagement to immersive shopping experiences to checkout.

“We believe that in order for brands to remain relevant, they must transform their way of thinking by placing a relentless focus on the customer at the heart of the entire customer journey,” said Tammy Soares, president of Rosetta. “By investing in our relationship with world-class partners like Adobe and developing intellectual property that’s expansive of new marketing cloud solutions, we have been able to help our clients solve their complex marketing challenges.”

In looking across the Razorfish network, the organization has worked with Adobe to develop numerous industry-leading solutions for clients powered by Adobe’s comprehensive Marketing and Creative Clouds, including: 

- Razorshop, a first of its kind connected retail experience that marries a customer loyalty application to a connected ecosystem of marketing, live data, commerce and analytics, creating a relevant dialogue between the physical store, the brand and the guest.
