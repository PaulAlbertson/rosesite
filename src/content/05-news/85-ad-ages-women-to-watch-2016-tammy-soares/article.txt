##Tammy Soares, CEO, Rosetta
In 1996, Tammy Soares was selling internet ads for one of the first recruitment websites, which HotJobs.com bought and eventually became part of Yahoo. That experience, including finance and business development responsibilities, prepared her to ultimately serve as CEO of Publicis Groupe's Rosetta, an agency that touts today's coveted consulting, CRM, technology and digital marketing capabilities. She joined the shop in 2008 as a project manager and seven years later had climbed the ranks to the top spot. Right after Ms. Soares assumed the CEO role, Rosetta achieved six months of consecutive growth and has since added a number of new clients, including Magic Leap, Amazon Web Services and Silicon Labs. Prior to taking the helm, she helped the shop grow its relationship with Samsung from monthly billings of $125,000 into a digital agency-of-record account with some of the shop's highest billings.

“This year’s list is especially significant, since it marks the 20th year of Advertising Age’s Women to Watch. Over those two decades, we have recognized hundreds of women who have achieved major milestones in the worlds of advertising, media and marketing,” said Ad Age Deputy Editor Judann Pollack. “With so much discussion about the relative lack of women at the top in advertising, lists like Women to Watch shine a much-needed spotlight on the women who are highly successful and inspirational for the next generation of women leaders. This year’s class comes from a diverse group of marketers — packaged goods companies, tech players, sports franchises, entertainment companies and more — as well as ad agency and media companies, but they share a drive and a desire to motivate and help other women succeed in this industry.
