		<h2>Let’s talk about your first day&hellip;</h2>

		<h3>When should I arrive?</h3>

		<p>Check in with guest services at the front desk by 9:30am on your first day. They will take your picture for your access badge, get you a cup of joe and get you to the right place for orientation.</p>

		<h3>What do I bring with me?</h3>

		<p>Bring your identification for the I-9, the notebook we sent you, enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence. We’ll get you all the other tools you’ll need.</p>

		<h3>What do I wear?</h3>

		<p>We expect all new employees in formal attire for their first week, so dust off those tuxedos and ball gowns! Just kidding. Business casual is the norm for all locations&mdash;sometimes leaning more toward the casual.</p>

		<h3>Am I on my own after orientation?</h3>

		<p>No way!  We will have a buddy for you to show you the ropes and get you on your way. Within a couple weeks of your starting date, you’ll be assigned a Career Manager who will focus on guiding you to success at Rosetta.</p>
