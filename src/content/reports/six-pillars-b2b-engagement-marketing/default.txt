Subtitle: It is time for B2B marketers to change the way they talk to and engage with their audience.

Text:

As customers demand more relevant and personal experiences, marketers have to stop spending money talking to the wrong people about things they donâ€™t care for. Doing so requires shifting from what we call brand-centric campaigns to more customer-led approaches to marketing based on self-perpetuating cycles of real-time, two-way, insight-driven interactions with individual customers.

Making this shift will dramatically improve how enterprise B2B brands drive demand, retain audiences and grow customer value.
