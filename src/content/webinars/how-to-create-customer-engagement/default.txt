----

Text:

Our recent survey of 4,800 consumers found that “highly engaged” customers spend 33% more in each transaction and are 6X more likely to be loyal to the brand.

So how do brands find these customers and create engagement?

Rosetta is hosting a webinar series to share specific strategies for brands that want to shift their marketing from one-off campaigns to ongoing cycles of customer engagement.

Our webinar series will address questions like:

- Why will a focus on ongoing engagement be more effective than what I am doing now?
- What are good examples of brands creating engagement across industries?
- How do I do it? What are the necessary business changes?
