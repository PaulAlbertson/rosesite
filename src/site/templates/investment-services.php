          <div class="unlocked-col">
            <p>We demonstrated that there was significant opportunity for our client to further “win” with these segments by acquiring prospects in the key segments and increasing its share of assets among existing customers.</p>

            <p>We analyzed the target segments to reveal that each had very distinct needs, attitudes, and behaviors toward investing as it relates to their confidence in making their own investment decisions, preferred primary channel of engagement and use of&nbsp;tools and resources.</p>

            <p>Based on our understanding of the segments, we identified opportunities to improve the customer experience across channels and during key “moments that matter.” We also identified organizational capabilities that were required to support the prioritized programs.</p>

            <p class="intro">Rosetta developed segment-based marketing solutions to guide the strategies and messages that were personalized for each segment.</p>
            <p>We redesigned the online experience and cross-channel touch points to align with customer needs, which created employee engagement programs to educate team members about segment profiles and business opportunities.</p>
            <p>As a result, the client’s marketing team was reorganized around the target segments to ensure an integrated customer experience.</p>

            <p>By embedding segment identification capabilities to tailor the customer experience across website, sales teams and all digital marketing channels, we optimized the media buying strategy around each customer segment’s media consumption habits.</p>
            <p>The results were measured, tracked and evaluated down to the segment level on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis.&nbsp;<span class="icon icon-endmark"></span></p>
